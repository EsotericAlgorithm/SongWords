# Song Lyric Learning
A tool to mashup lyrics and music videos for language learning.
A portion of the lyrics are displayed and the user must fill
in the lyrics as they hear them. I wrote this for myself to 
practice spanish.

Some websites offer this but didn't meet my needs. Examples include:   
[Lyricgaps](www.lyricsgap.com)    
[LyricsTraining](lyricstraining.com)
